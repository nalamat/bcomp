# BCOMP

Gate Level Simulation of The Basic Computer


## What is BCOMP?

BCOMP is a gate level design and simulation of The Basic Computer performed in
Proteus ISIS Schematic Capture. Gate level design is in contrast to lower
transistor level or higher abstraction block or conceptual diagrams, meaning
the smallest block used in the design is a logical gate. Gates are available
for hardware implementation through various logical ICs e.g. 7400 TTL series or
4000 CMOS series.

This simulation is complementary to the BASM project: The Basic Computer
Assembler (http://github.com/nalamat/basm). Assembled binary output of BASM can
be directly loaded into the memory of BCOMP and the simulation can show how
does the computer really operate with the instructions given by assembly
language.
